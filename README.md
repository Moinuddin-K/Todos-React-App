In this Assignment we were required to create a full end to end todolist application which involves frontend and backend.
We used REST API fron assignment 8 and used it as an API to make todo calls to the server. We are required to run our assignment 8 in order to keep the server running.

We have a todos-app which consists of our react application

I have used 4 components to render the page:
Header, Todo-List, TodoForm, TodoListitem

## Instructions to run the Project:

1. Clone the REPO to your local desktop.
2. Open the Project on Visual Studio Code.
3. Run the command create-react-app todos-app to create our react app template
4. Download the required dependencies like sass by npm i sass --save.
6. Run the server by typing npm start.
7. Now once the server is running we can go to our local host url to check the website.
